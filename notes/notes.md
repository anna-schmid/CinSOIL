# Notes

## What can I find here? 

Here is where I collect all the Data sources that I explored. Currently exploring Soil Data, Elevation Data, potentially further Satellite Data, Weather Data and Carbon Flux Data. 


Just in general key notes to check out: 
- “Caring for Soil” mission of the European Commission
- WorldSoils (http://www.world-soils.com/, accessed on 7 Aug 2025) of the European Space Agency (ESA)
- STEROPES of the European Joint H2020 Program SOIL (https://ejpsoil.eu, accessed on 07 Aug 2025) - more importantly check out https://ejpsoil.eu/soil-data/ and https://catalogue.ejpsoil.eu (this looks like a catalogue listing a set of datasets around soil data in Europe (coming from [@vadour2022] )).
